# BitChatClient
Technitium Bit Chat is a secure, peer-to-peer (p2p), open source instant messenger designed to provide end-to-end encryption. Primary aim of developing this instant messenger is to provide privacy which is achieved using strong cryptography. It can be used over Internet and private LAN networks for instant messaging and file transfer.

The architecture is designed keeping in mind the security principle that everybody is secure or no one is. There is no meta data generated when you use Bit Chat. The only thing that we know, is the email address of the user who registered for a digital certificate. The digital certificate tells that the email address was verified, which is similar, in concept, to any domain validated SSL certificate issued to a website.

Development is still in progress and new features will be made available as an when they are coded. The software has automatic update feature which will keep you updated with latest version available.
